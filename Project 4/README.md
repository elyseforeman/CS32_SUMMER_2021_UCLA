TunnelMan is the final project for Introduction to Computer Science II taught by Edwin Ambrosio (Summer 2020, UCLA). 

Students were provided with the skeleton of a game including graphics files found under Executable. Students were to edit the header and source code files to design both the interface and implementation of TunnelMan. Students decided on the inhertitance hierarchy, the total number of classes, and the assignment of over 20 objects to different classes. Details on my hierarchy and the functions that I implemented can be found in report.docx. 

In gameplay, the player takes the role of TunnelMan, a miner drilling for oil to the outrage of protestors. TunnelMan begins the game with three lives, which can be exhausted by encounters with “normal” or “hardcore” protestors and falling boulders. Beginning at level zero, TunnelMan can move up through each level by digging (arrow keys / WASD) to find all of the oil objects hidden around the unique field configuration. TunnelMan will encounter a number of other objects, each with different functions, such as WaterPools to fill a water gun that is used to shoot protestors (Spacebar), or SonarKits that make visible all objects within a limited radius. 

To run TunnelMan on a Windows machine, enter the executable directory and run $ ./TunnelMan.exe
